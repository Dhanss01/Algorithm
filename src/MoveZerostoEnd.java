/*
 * in a given integer move the zeros alone to left side 
 * 1) Did I understand the problem? 
 * 
 * 2) What is the input(s)? What is the expected output? Do I have constraints to
 * solve the problem? 
 * 
 * Input- int[] nums =[1,2,3,0,4,0]
 * Output -int[] nums =[0,0,1,2,3,4]
 *  Constraint- 
 * 
 * 3) Test data set
 * 
 * Positive- : s =[
     Negative -: s=[0]
      Edge -: s=[]
 * 
 * 
 * 4) Do I know how to solve it?
 * 
 * Yes - great, is there an alternate? 
 * 4) Ask for hint if don't know to solve? 
 * 
 * 5) Do i know any alternate solution? 
 *    -> No, Solve with the known solution
 *    
 *    Pseudo code
